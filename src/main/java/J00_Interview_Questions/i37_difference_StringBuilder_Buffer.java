    /*
    StringBuffer is another class to create String in java.
    StringBuffer is very similar with  String Builder Class I mean both are mutable


    what is the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

    1- StringBuffer was created before StringBuilder in java
    2- StringBuffer is "multi-thread" but StringBuilder is not
    3- StringBuffer is using  "multi-thread" characteristic because of that it is slower StringBuilder

    scenarios:

    1- I need immutable String --> String class
    2- I need mutable  and not multi-thread --> StringBuilder
    1- I need mutable and multi-thread --> StringBuffer
