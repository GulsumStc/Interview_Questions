        /*
    1- Constructor are used to create abject form a class
    2- Java puts default constructor inside every class
    3- Default constructor does not have any parameters iniside the constructor parenthesis
    4- Constructor names must match with the class names
    5- In a class we can have multiple constructor

  ===========  how to create a constructor ================

    1- type accsess modifier
    2- type the class name as constructor name
    3- Open-close pharenthesis
    4- Open curly brace press enter

    if we create our constructor java will remove default constructor.

   ============== What are differences between "constructors" and "Methods"============?????????????????

    1- constructors do not have" return type" but methods have.
       this is way java runtime distinguish between a normal method and a constructor.
    2- Constructor names must be same with the class name because of that you can not decide constructor names
       but method names can be assigned by developer
    3- Constructors are used to create abjects ////// methods used to create some action

     Note:     if any class you want to use if it is in the same package no need to  import .
      but if the class  is in the different package, you have to import it.
